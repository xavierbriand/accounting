# Product Brief: accounting

<!-- Content will be appended sequentially through collaborative workflow steps -->

## Executive Summary

The **Couples Expense Sharing App** is a **Predictive Asset-Based Financial Engine** designed to replace reactive, stress-inducing joint account top-ups with a stable, fair, and forward-looking financial operating system.

Unlike traditional budgeting apps that merely track past spending, this system uses a **Multi-Layered Equity Model** to decouple "Income-based" operational expenses from "Asset-based" wealth building, ensuring true fairness for couples with disparate financial situations. To build trust without overwhelming complexity, the app acts as a **"Conversational CFO,"** translating sophisticated math into simple, actionable insights. By organizing data into **"Life Objects"** (House, Car, Vacation) with simple **"Buffer Buckets,"** the engine smooths financial volatility into a predictable monthly contribution.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement
Couples with joint finances often struggle with the "Transfer Problem": determining exactly how much each partner should contribute to the joint account to cover shared life expenses. Current methods—usually reactive top-ups when the account hits zero or static monthly transfers—create constant low-grade anxiety, friction around "who pays for what," and a lack of transparency regarding true financial equity.

### Problem Impact
- **Financial Anxiety:** The "floating floor" of liquidity is often breached, leading to missed payments or urgent transfer requests.
- **Relationship Friction:** Ambiguity about what constitutes a "fair share" (especially when incomes or assets differ) erodes trust.
- **Volatility:** Large, irregular expenses (car repair, annual insurance) break the monthly budget, making financial planning impossible.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short
- **Spreadsheets:** Brittle, require manual maintenance, and lack predictive intelligence.
- **Traditional Apps:** Focus on *tracking* (backward-looking) rather than *predicting* (forward-looking). They typically treat all money as "Income," failing to distinguish between operational cashflow and asset-based wealth.
- **Static Budgets:** Fail to account for seasonality or asset maintenance, leading to "surprise" shortages.

### Proposed Solution
A **Predictive Pre-Funding Engine** that treats the household as an organization with "Life Objects."
1.  **Multi-Layered Equity:** Splits operational costs by Income Ratio and asset-building costs by Wealth Ratio.
2.  **Predictive Smoothing (Buffer Buckets):** Uses simple buckets (e.g., "Car Maintenance") that fill up monthly to pre-fund future irregularities.
3.  **Liquidity Controller:** Actively manages cashflow timing to ensure the joint account never dips below a safety floor.
4.  **Conversational CFO:** A chat-based interface that translates complex logic into simple updates ("Transfer $100 more this month to fill the Vacation Bucket"), building trust through clarity.

### Key Differentiators
- **"Fairness" as a First-Class Citizen:** The only tool that mathematically distinguishes between *Income Rich* and *Asset Rich* scenarios.
- **"Complexity Explained":** Hides the actuarial math behind a friendly "Conversational CFO" that explains *why* costs are changing.
- **Actionable "Buffer Buckets":** Replaces complex risk curves with simple, fillable buckets for tangible assets (Car, House).

## Target Users

### Primary Users

**1. The "CFO Partner" (The Burden Carrier)**
*   **Role:** The "Financial Architect" of the household.
*   **Motivation:** Craves control, fairness, and system stability. Wants to share the mental load of financial management but feels guilty "nagging" for money.
*   **Pain Point:** Currently maintains a brittle Excel sheet that requires constant manual updates. Carries the anxiety of "Did we save enough for the car insurance?" alone.
*   **Goal:** Wants a "Set it and Forget it" system that proves the math is fair and automates the request, transforming their role from "Nag" to "Administrator."
*   **Interaction:** Sets up the "Life Objects," configures the "Buffer Buckets," and reviews the "Transparency Dashboard."

**2. The "Participant Partner" (The Context-Seeker)**
*   **Role:** The "Financial Contributor."
*   **Motivation:** Wants to be a good partner and pay their share but lacks visibility into the details.
*   **Pain Point:** Feels "Context-Blind"—anxious when asked for random amounts of money ("Why $200 more?") and fearful of overdrawing their personal account.
*   **Goal:** Wants a simple, predictable monthly number and *context* ("The extra $200 is for the car insurance due in March"). Wants to move from Passive payer to Active participant.
*   **Interaction:** Interacts almost exclusively via the "Conversational CFO" (Chat). Receives alerts with context, confirms payments, and checks bucket status.

### User Journey (The "Trust Loop")

1.  **Discovery (The "Excel Wall"):** The CFO Partner hits a wall with their spreadsheet complexity or a major argument occurs over a "surprise" bill.
2.  **Onboarding (The "Forensic Audit"):**
    *   CFO imports bank data. System identifies "Life Objects" (Car, House).
    *   **Liquidity Check:** System asks: "Do you have existing savings for Car Repairs?"
    *   CFO sets up "Buffer Buckets."
3.  **The "Fairness" Setup:**
    *   Partners input incomes and assets. System calculates the "Equity Split."
4.  **Core Loop (Monthly):**
    *   **Day 1:** System runs the "Predictive Engine."
    *   **Day 2:** "Conversational CFO" texts both partners: "Good morning! Monthly Transfer is $1,600. This includes $100 for the Car Buffer."
    *   **Day 3:** Partners transfer. System confirms "Liquidity Safe."
    *   **Day 15:** Car breaks down ($400). CFO pays from Joint. System auto-tags to "Car Bucket."
    *   **Day 16:** Chat update: "Car Bucket used. Remaining: $200. No extra transfer needed." (The "Aha!" moment).
5.  **The "System Blame" Safety Net:**
    *   If a prediction fails (Bucket empty), the System takes the blame: *"My prediction for car maintenance was too low. We're short $200. I've updated the model. Pull from Vacation bucket?"* (Prevents couple conflict).

## Success Metrics

### User Success Metrics (Outcomes)

*   **The "Zero-Stress" Transfer:**
    *   *Metric:* >90% of monthly transfers completed within 24 hours of notification.
    *   *Why:* Fast compliance indicates high trust; hesitation indicates friction/doubt.
*   **The "Thriving" Buffer (Replacing "Zero Overdraft"):**
    *   *Metric:* Months of Continuous Buffer Growth (Net Positive Flow).
    *   *Why:* Shifts focus from "survival" (avoiding overdraft) to "wealth building" (accumulating reserves).
*   **The "No-Surprise" Maintenance:**
    *   *Metric:* >90% of irregular expenses (>$200) are covered by an existing "Buffer Bucket" balance.
    *   *Why:* Validates the "Predictive Pre-Funding" promise.

### Business Objectives (North Star)

*   **Trust Retention:**
    *   *Objective:* Users stick with the platform because it holds their "Financial Truth."
    *   *KPI:* <5% Churn Rate after Month 3 (High switching costs due to accumulated buffers).
*   **Conflict De-Escalation:**
    *   *Objective:* The System successfully acts as the neutral arbiter.
    *   *KPI:* **Unedited Transfer Rate > 80%**. (If users accept the calculated transfer without editing it, they trust the system's fairness).

### Key Performance Indicators (Technical Health)

*   **Fixed Cost Accuracy:** Variance between Predicted vs Actual Fixed Costs < 5%.
*   **Buffer Utilization Health:** Variance between "Predicted Buffer Fill" and "Actual Chaos Expenses" tracked separately to refine risk models.
*   **Onboarding Velocity:** Time from "Sign Up" to "First Successful Predictive Transfer" < 7 days.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (The "Transfer Engine")

**1. The Predictive Engine:**
*   **Forensic Ingestion:** Ingests 3 months of bank history (CSV import) and auto-classifies transactions into "Life Objects" (Car, House, Utilities).
*   **Calculation Logic:** Calculates "Fixed Costs" + "Buffer Contribution" = Monthly Transfer.
*   **Liquidity Controller:** Ensures the transfer amount covers immediate bills + builds safety floor.

**2. The Equity Calculator:**
*   **Inputs:** Income (Net), Assets (Savings/Investments).
*   **Logic:** Calculates Split Ratio for Operations (Income-based) vs Assets (Wealth-based).
*   **Transparency:** Shows the math ("You pay 60% of groceries, but 50% of the mortgage").

**3. The "Buffer Bucket" System:**
*   **Virtual Ledger:** Sub-ledgers for House, Car, Vacation.
*   **Flow:** Logic to "Fill" buckets monthly and "Drain" them when transactions are tagged.
*   **Safety Net:** Logic to handle empty buckets (System Blame/Reallocation).

**4. The Conversational Interface:**
*   **Interaction:** Text-based output (CLI/Chat).
*   **Notifications:** "Transfer $1,600. ($100 -> Car Buffer)."
*   **Feedback:** Accepts commands like "Paid" or "Spent $400 on tires."

### Out of Scope for MVP

*   **Real-time Bank Sync (Plaid/GoCardless):** CSV import only to reduce cost and complexity.
*   **Investment Tracking:** Focus is on *contributions* to assets, not market value tracking.
*   **Bill Splitting (Splitwise style):** We pre-fund the Joint Account; we do not manage micro-reimbursements (coffee/lunch).
*   **Mobile App:** Responsive Web or CLI only.

### MVP Success Criteria

*   **Validation:** 10 Beta users complete 3 consecutive "Unedited Transfers."
*   **Technical:** "Fixed Cost Prediction" is accurate within 5% for >80% of users.
*   **Value:** Users report a reduction in "Financial Anxiety" (qualitative survey).

### Future Vision

*   **Phase 2:** "Bank Sync" (Auto-import).
*   **Phase 3:** "The Arbitrator" (AI that negotiates conflict).
*   **Phase 4:** "The Family Office" (Estate planning, kids, insurance optimization).
